    <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>There's just something right about a quesadilla. It's easy to make and it's filling. Not the kind of filling in the quesadilla, the kind of filling that makes you not eat when you're bored before your next meal.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>1 cup mayonaise</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon taco seasoning</li>

            <li>2 teaspoons hot sauce</li>
            <li>6 tortillas</li>
            <li>2 cups mexican cheese mix</li>
            <li>2 cups shredded chicken, seasoned</li>
        </ul>
